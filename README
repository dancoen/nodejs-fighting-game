This is a project I have decided to start in my desire to gain experience in both Node.js 
as well creating multiplayer video games. I plan to make a simple fighting game based around 
classic sf2 fireball/antiair gameplay. more details to come!

How to run:

Just use any httpserver to host your files locally. For example, using python 2.7:

navigate to cloned directory and type: 

(python 2) $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
(python 3) $ python -m http.server 8080


then, in a web browser (chrome) go to localhost:8080 and click on game.html 
and you should be able to playtest the game.
